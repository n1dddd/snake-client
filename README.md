# üêç Snake Game Client Project 

The classic game of snake where a player controls a long, thin creature, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.

This is a client sided download, ensure that you have the server side running in parallel.

## Purpose

**This project was made by [Daniel Seniv](https://github.com/n1dddd) and was completed as part of the [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs) curriculum.**


## Acknowledgements

This project was not built from scratch. The server sided code was refashioned from[snek](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) ([blog post](https://www.taniarascia.com/snake-game-in-javascript/)). [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com) is the original author of the server sided code.
